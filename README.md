This simulation will include morphology from a Golgi Cell (ModelDB: Cerebellar Golgi Cell Model with Na+/K+ ATPase ~~ Developers:  Fabio M Simoes de Souza & E De Schutter)

Where these Golgi Cells are then connected to dummy Pyramidal Cells (Morphology is noy based off of any actual experiements), this Pyramidal cell will jsut have a simple construction (Geometry and Mechanisms)
