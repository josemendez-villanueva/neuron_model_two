This script is a modification from a previous published GoC model
(Solinas et al., 2007). A Na+/K+ ATPase and ionic concentration pools
for Na+, K+, Ca2+ were incorporated into the soma of the model.
The equations that simulated the Na+/K+ ATPase are described in Table
S10 of Takeuchi et al. (2006)

Abstract

Alcohol Excites Cerebellar Golgi Cells by Inhibiting the Na+/K+ ATPase
Patch-clamp in cerebellar slices and computer modeling show that
ethanol excites Golgi cells by inhibiting the Na+/K+ ATPase. In
particular, voltage-clamp recordings of Na+/K+ ATPase currents
indicated that ethanol partially inhibits this pump and this effect
could be mimicked by low concentrations of the Na+/K+ ATPase blocker
ouabain. The partial inhibition of Na+/K+ ATPase in a computer model
of the Golgi cell reproduced these experimental findings that
established a novel mechanism of action of ethanol on neural
excitability.

Usage instructions:

Auto-launch from ModelDB or download and extract the archive.  Then
under:

----
MSWIN

run mknrndll, cd to the archive and make the nrnmech.dll.  Then double
click on the mosinit.hoc file.

----
MAC OS X

Drag and drop the Golgi_cell_NaKATPAse folder onto the mknrndll icon.
Drag and drop the mosinit.hoc file onto the nrngui icon.

----
Linux/Unix

Change directory to the Golgi_cell_NaKATPAse folder. run
nrnivmodl. Then type nrngui mosinit.hoc

----

Once the simulation is started click the button labeled 
"Figure 7g from Botta et al. 2010" The simulation will produce a
result similar to figure 7g from the paper:

20140305 An update was made to pump.mod to make the model current with
a new version of NEURON (hg revision 1027) while retaining
compatibility with old versions. The number of parameters in settables
was made to match the number of the calling instances.
